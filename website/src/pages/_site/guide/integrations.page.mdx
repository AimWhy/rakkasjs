# Integrations

Integrating a non-trivial tool or library into a Rakkas app usually entails some of the following:

- Adding Vite plugins or tweaking Vite configuration options. Rakkas exposes the [Vite configuration](./configuration-options#vite) in `rakkas.config.{js,ts}`.
- Wrapping the React application element in a React context provider (e.g. `ApolloProvider` for Apollo). Rakkas allows you to wrap your app in provider components. You can even wrap it differently on the server-side and on the client using [customization hooks](./customization-hooks).
- Applying a Babel plugin. Rakkas already uses Babel, you can add more plugins [in your configuration](./configuration-options#babel).
- Injecting HTML markup into the generated document's head: [Server-side customization hooks](./customization-hooks#server-side) support this use case via `getHeadHtml`.
