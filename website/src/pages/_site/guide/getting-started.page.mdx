# Getting started

> ðŸš€ Thanks to StackBlitz, you can now **try Rakkas online, right in your browser**!
>
> - [Rakkas **TypeScript** demo](https://stackblitz.com/edit/rakkas-demo-ts?file=src%2Fpages%2Fpage.tsx)
> - [Rakkas **JavaScript** demo](https://stackblitz.com/edit/rakkas-demo?file=src%2Fpages%2Fpage.jsx)

The easiest way to try Rakkas out on your computer is to use the project initializer:

```bash
# Create the project directory
mkdir my-app && cd my-app
# Scaffold the demo app: Follow the prompts for the rest
npx create-rakkas-app@latest
```

`create-rakkas-app` project initializer comes with many features, all off which are optional but we strongly recommend enabling TypeScript on your first project because self-documenting type definitions allow for a smoother learning curve.

Demo project's source code comes with plenty of comments, you may not need this guide!

> ðŸ‘· If you prefer a manual setup, you can install `rakkasjs`, `@rakkasjs/runner-node`, `react`, `react-dom`, and `react-helmet-async` as production dependencies, and `@rakkasjs/cli` as a dev dependency:
>
> ```bash
> npm install --save rakkasjs @rakkasjs/runner-node react react-dom react-helmet-async
> npm install --save-dev @rakkasjs/cli
> ```
>
> Then you can start a development server on `localhost:3000` with `npx rakkas dev`, build with `npx rakkas build`, and launch with `npx @rakkasjs/runner-node`.

## Project structure

By default, `create-rakkas-app` generates a project with the following structure:

| Path                 | Description                                                                |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/package.json`      | npm package file                                                           |
| `/rakkas.config.js`Â¹ | Rakkas [configuration file](./configuration-options)                       |
| `/public`            | [Static files](./static-files) to be served from `/`                       |
| `/src/client.js`Â¹    | [Client-side customization hooks](./customization-hooks#server-side)       |
| `/src/server.js`Â¹    | [Server-side customization hooks](./customization-hooks#client-side)       |

| `/src/api`           | [Endpoints and middlewares](./api-routes) (server-side routes)             |
