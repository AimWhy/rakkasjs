# Layout context

A Rakkas layout is not just a simple wrapper component, it also acts as data fetching middleware for nested layouts and pages. A layout's `load` function, unlike a page's, can return a `context` object which will be passed down to lower level layouts and pages. Both the `load` functions and the React components receive this as a prop. `context` objects returned from nested layouts are shallowly merged with the parent one. All context values must be serializable by `devalue`.

> ⚠️ There's no relation with the React context API and Rakkas's layout context system.

Let's say you have two pages, `/widget/[widgetId]/view` and `/widget/[widgetId]/edit` which views and edits a widget respectively. Both pages will need the contents of the widget. You can achieve this, without duplicating your code in both pages, by creating a layout `/widget/[widgetId]/layout.jsx` that fetches the widget data and passes it down to the pages using the `context` mechanism. You don't even have to define a component for your layout if it's only used for data fetching:

import contextExampleLayout from "$examples/widget/[widgetId]/layout.tsx?sample";
import contextExampleView from "$examples/widget/[widgetId]/view.page.tsx?sample";
import contextExampleEdit from "$examples/widget/[widgetId]/edit.page.tsx?sample";

<SampleViewer
	filename="pages/widget/[widgetId]/layout.tsx"
	code={contextExampleLayout}
/>
<SampleViewer
	filename="pages/widget/[widgetId]/view.page.tsx"
	code={contextExampleView}
/>
<SampleViewer
	filename="pages/widget/[widgetId]/edit.page.tsx"
	code={contextExampleEdit}
	url="/examples/widget/Foo/view"
	height="12em"
/>

## Root context and server-side customization hooks

The context passed to the outermost page or layout can be initialized **on the server-side** when the page is first served. To do so, you export a `servePage` function from `src/server.js` (or `.ts`):

import serverHook from "$examples/server.ts?sample";

<SampleViewer filename="src/server.ts" code={serverHook} />

Both `server.ts/.js` and `servePage` exports are optional. If not provided, the root context will be `{}`. The root context value can be updated on the client by calling the `setRootContext` function exported from `rakkasjs` module. The value will not be persisted on the server, you'll have to implement it yourself.

The root context can be used for session management among other things.
