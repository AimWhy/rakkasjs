# Static files

If you put some files in a directory named `public` in your project root, Rakkas will serve them from the root of your website. For example, if you have a file named `public/some-dir/file.txt` Rakkas will make it available on the path `/some-dir/file.txt`.

It is a good way to serve favicons and files like `robots.txt`. You can refer to [Vite's documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/assets.html#the-public-directory) for the details.
