# Pages and routing

In Rakkas, a page is a React component default exported from a module in the `src/pages` directory, named `page.jsx` or anything that matches `*.page.jsx` (or `tsx`, or any other extension included in the `pageExtensions` [configuration option](./configuration-options)).

Rakkas has a file system-based router. The file name determines the URL path. The rules are easy:

| Module name                | URL path      |
| -------------------------- | ------------- |
| `src/pages/page.jsx`       | `/`           |
| `src/pages/about.page.jsx` | `/about`      |
| `src/pages/about/page.jsx` | also `/about` |

This specific naming convention (`(name.)?page.{extension}`) allows you to have your helper libraries and components next to your page components without accidentally exposing them as routes.

A very simple Rakkas page would look like this:

import helloExample from "$examples/hello/page.jsx?sample";

<SampleViewer
	filename="src/pages/page.jsx"
	code={helloExample}
	url="/examples/hello"
/>

Rakkas supports [`react-helmet-async`](https://github.com/staylor/react-helmet-async#readme) for managing head tags (`title`, `base`, `meta`, `link`, `script`, `noscript`, and `style`) and attributes for `body`, `html`, and `title` tags.

## Dynamic routes <a id="dynamic-routes"/>

Sometimes you need to encode parameters in the URL path like `/post/1`, `/post/2` etc. Dynamic routes like this are handled using `[square brackets]`. If you have a file named `/src/pages/profile/[userName].page.jsx`, for instance, and you visit `/profile/fatih`, your page component will receive `{ userName: "fatih" }` in `props.params` like in the example below.

import paramsExample from "$examples/params/[userName].page.jsx?sample";

<SampleViewer
	filename="[userName].page.jsx"
	code={paramsExample}
	url="/examples/params/Fatih"
/>

> Go ahead and can click on the links, they won't take you away from this page.

You can use more than one dynamic parameter like `/user/[userName]/posts/[postId]`. You can even put multiple parameters in a single path segment if you delimit them with `-` or `.`, like `/user-[name]-[surname]/contact-info` (matches `/user-fatih-aygun/contact-info` with `params: { name: "fatih", surname: "aygun" }` for instance).

More specific routes have priority over more generic ones, so you can have both `/products/list` for a specific match and `/products/[productId]` as a catch-all route.
