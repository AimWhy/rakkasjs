# Environment variables

Rakkas handles environment variables [exactly like Vite does](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html) which means `process.env` and `import.meta.env` will be expanded **in build-time**. This causes problems if you want to use environment variables for the configuration because you will have to rebuild your app every time you change an environment variable.

There is an [open issue](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/3176) on the Vite side about this limitation. One way around it is to use `(0, eval)("process.env")` to access the real runtime environment variables for the time being.
