# Environment variables

Rakkas handles environment variables [the same way as Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html), which means `process.env` and `import.meta.env` will be expanded **in build-time**. This causes problems if you want to use environment variables for configuration because you will have to rebuild your app every time you change an environment variable.

There is an [open issue](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/3176) on the Vite side about this limitation. One way around it is to use `(0, eval)("process.env")` for the time being to access the real runtime environment variables.

## Configuration through environment variables

A Rakkas production server supports the following environment variables:

| Variable                 | Description                              |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `TRUST_FORWARDED_ORIGIN` | Whether to trust `x-forwarded-*` headers |
| `HOST`                   | Server host                              |
| `PORT`                   | HTTP port                                |
