# Static site generation

You can render a static version of your site with the command `rakkas export`. Rakkas will build a special version of your application into a temporary directory, start the server, and visit all the pages it can discover, starting from the root `/` and export a static site into the directory `dist/static`. You can preview it with, e.g., `npx sirv dist/static`. A static site doesn't need a Node.js server, you can serve it from a CDN or a static file server, such as **Github pages**.

Not every Rakkas app is suitable to be exported as a static site. You can do it if and only if the contents of each and every page in your app are solely determined by its URL path. In particular, if the content depends on any of the following, it is not suitable to be a static page:

- Cookies: A static site can't show different contents to different visitors, so you can't have any sort of session management.
- Query parameters: A static site can't load different data based on query parameters. Path parameters are fine, though. So, instead of a URL pattern like `/books?page=2` you should prefer `/books/page-2` if you intent to export a static site.

You can have still `load` functions for your layouts and pages but they will be run during **build-time** instead of run-time. In fact, they will be stripped off of the final bundle to optimize asset sizes.
