# Layouts

Not many websites consist of completely independent pages. For instance, this very guide (which was made with Rakkas, of course - so meta!) has a header, a footer, and a navigation menu that are common to all pages. Rakkas provides a nested layout system to handle this use case. If you create a file named `layout.jsx` (or `tsx`, or any other extension included in the `pageExtensions` [configuration option](./configuration-options)) that default exports a React component, pages in the same directory and pages or nested layouts in its subdirectories will be wrapped by the layout.

import layoutExampleLayout from "$examples/layout/layout.jsx?sample";
import layoutExampleHome from "$examples/layout/index.page.jsx?sample";
import layoutExampleAbout from "$examples/layout/about.page.jsx?sample";

<SampleViewer filename="routes/layout.jsx" code={layoutExampleLayout} />
<SampleViewer filename="routes/index.page.jsx" code={layoutExampleHome} />
<SampleViewer
	filename="routes/about.page.jsx"
	code={layoutExampleAbout}
	url="/examples/layout"
	height="12em"
/>

## Thematic grouping

Sometimes you want pages that don't share a common URL prefix to share a layout. You can group such pages under a directory with a name that starts with an underscore. The directory name will not be part of the URL path. For example you could have a directory structure like this:

- `routes/`
  - `layout.jsx` (the root layout, common to all pages)
  - `_app/` (thematic group for most pages)
    - `layout.jsx` (common layout for most pages)
    - `page.jsx` (path: `/`)
    - `about.page.jsx` (path: `/about`)
    - `blog.page.jsx` (path: `/blog`)
  - `_admin` (thematic group for admin pages)
    - `layout.jsx` (common layout for admin pages)
    - `settings.page.jsx` (path: `/settings`)
    - `users.page.jsx` (path: `/users`)
