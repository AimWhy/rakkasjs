title: Dynamic routes
---

You often need to encode parameters in the URL path like `/post/1`, `/post/2` etc. Dynamic routes like this are handled using square brackets (`[]`). If you have a file named `/src/routes/profile/[userName].page.jsx`, for instance, and you visit `/profile/Fatih`, your page component will receive `{ userName: "Fatih" }` in `props.params` like in the example below.

<CodeViewer
	name="guide-samples"
	openFiles={["src/routes/dynamic/[userName].page.tsx"]}
	url="/dynamic/Fatih"
/>

You can use more than one dynamic parameter like `/user/[userName]/posts/[postId]`. You can even put multiple parameters in a single path segment like `/user-[name]-[surname]/contact-info` (matches `/user-fatih-aygun/contact-info` with `params: { name: "fatih", surname: "aygun" }` for instance).

More specific routes have priority over generic ones, so you can have both `/products/list` for a specific match and `/products/[productId]` as a catch-all route.

### Spread parameters

You can use the `[...paramName]` syntax to match more than one segment at the end of a route. For instance, `/path/[...rest]` will match `/path/aaa/bbb/ccc/` with `params: { rest: "/aaa/bbb/ccc" }`, `/path` with `params: { rest: "" }`, and `/path/` with `params: { rest: "/" }`.
