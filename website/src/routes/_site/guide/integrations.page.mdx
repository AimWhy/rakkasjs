title: Integrations

Integrating a non-trivial tool or library into a Rakkas app usually entails some of the following:

- Adding Vite plugins or tweaking Vite configuration options. Rakkas respects the settings in the `vite.config.js` (or `.ts`) file.
- Tweaking various aspects of the app using the [client](client-entry), [server](hattip-entry), and [common](common-hooks) customization hooks.

## Examples

- [Emotion](https://github.com/rakkasjs/rakkasjs/tree/main/examples/emotion)
- [MDX](https://github.com/rakkasjs/rakkasjs/tree/main/examples/mdx)
- [GraphQL](https://github.com/rakkasjs/rakkasjs/tree/main/examples/apollo)

Also check out [RealWorld example app](https://github.com/rakkasjs/rakkas-realworld) for a simple but complete full stack application demonstrating how to approach building a REST API, accessing your database (via [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io)), handling authentication, deployment (Node, Vercel, Netlify, and Cloudflare Workers) and more.
