# Serving static files

Rakkas serves the files in the `public` directory in your project root from the root of your website. For example, if you have a file named `public/some-dir/file.txt` Rakkas will make it available on your website on the path `/some-dir/file.txt`.

It is a good way to serve **favicons** and files like `robots.txt`. You can refer to [Vite's documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/assets.html#the-public-directory) for the details.
