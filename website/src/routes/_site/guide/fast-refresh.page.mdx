title: Fast refresh
---

Rakkas supports Fast Refresh which allows you to edit your components and get immediate feedback for your changes without having to reload the page. Function components will be updated without losing their state (class components _will_ lose their state).

Fast Refresh only works on files that **only export React components**. Exporting any other value will fall back to a full reload. Exporting _types_ is OK.
