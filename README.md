**Rakkas** aims to be a [React](https://reactjs.org) framework powered by [Vite](https://vitejs.dev), with a developer experience inspired by [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [Svelte Kit](https://kit.svelte.dev).

	// Reload when one of the values in this array change
	deps: [params.slug],
	// Reload when window receives focus
	focus: true,
	// Reload when the internet connection is restored after a disconnection
	reconnect: true,
	// Set to true to reload immediately after hydration
	hydrate: false,
	// Set to i.e. 15_000 to reload every 15 seconds
	interval: false,
	// Set to true to reload even when the window has no focus
	background: false,
})
