## What is Rakkas?

**Rakkas** is a web framework powered by [React](https://reactjs.org) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) that aims to have a developer experience similar to [Next.js](https://nextjs.org). Many of its features are also inspired by [Svelte Kit](https://kit.svelte.dev). Important features are:

- ‚ö°&nbsp; Lightning fast development
- üñ•Ô∏è&nbsp; Hassle free server-side rendering
- üöÄ&nbsp; Support for deploying on serverless environments
- üìÑ&nbsp; Static site generation
- üá∫üá≥&nbsp; Localizable URLs
- üîÄ&nbsp; Rendering modes (pre-rendering, server-side, client-side)
- ‚ò∏Ô∏è&nbsp; SPA-style client-side navigation
- üìÅ&nbsp; Intuitive file system-based routing
- ‚¨áÔ∏è&nbsp; Simple but effective data fetching system
- ‚öôÔ∏è&nbsp; API routes to build and organize your backend

See the [feature comparison with Next.js](https://rakkasjs.org/guide/feature-comparison) for other supported and planned features.

## Is Rakkas right for you?

- Although many features have been implemented, Rakkas is still in development. There _will_ be breaking changes until we hit 1.0. As such, it's **not yet ready for production use**. If you need a stable React framework try Next.js or [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/).
- Rakkas doesn't aim compatibility with Next.js. Check out [Vitext](https://github.com/Aslemammad/vitext) if you want to port a Next.js application to Vite.
- Rakkas is somewhat opinionated. If you need more flexibility try [vite-ssr-plugin](https://vite-plugin-ssr.com/).

## Getting started

> üöÄ You can now **try Rakkas online, right in your browser**!
>
> - [Rakkas **TypeScript** demo app on StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/rakkas-demo-ts?file=src%2Fpages%2Fpage.tsx)
> - [Rakkas **JavaScript** demo app on StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/rakkas-demo?file=src%2Fpages%2Fpage.jsx)

The easiest way to try Rakkas out on your computer is to use the project initializer:

```bash
# Create the project directory
mkdir my-app && cd my-app
# Scaffold the demo app: Follow the prompts for the rest
npx create-rakkas-app@latest
```

`create-rakkas-app` project initializer comes with many features, all off which are optional but we strongly recommend enabling TypeScript and the generation of a demo project on your first try because self-documenting type definitions allow for a smoother learning curve and the demo project source code comes with plenty of comments. You may not need this guide!

> üë∑ If you prefer a manual setup, you can install `rakkasjs`, `react`, `react-dom`, and `react-helmet-async` as production dependencies, and `@rakkasjs/cli` as a dev dependency:
>
> ```bash
> npm install --save rakkasjs react react-dom react-helmet-async
> npm install --save-dev @rakkasjs/cli
> ```
>
> Then you can start a development server on `localhost:3000` with `npx rakkas dev`, build with `npx rakkas build`, and launch with `node dist/server`.
